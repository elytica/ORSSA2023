\section{Introduction}
Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are systems that use point-to-multipoint fiber to the premises in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve multiple endpoints. Designing a cost-effective and efficient PON is critical to ensure optimal performance and investment returns.

\section{Problem Statement}
Given a distribution network, the objective is to plan the optimal placement of splitters and the routing of fibers in such a way that the total network cost is minimized. 

\subsection{Specifications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The central office is represented by squares and serves as the main connection hub.
    \item Optical Network Units (ONUs) are endpoints represented by circles (type).
    \item Splitters have a fixed capacity of 32 and are represented by triangles (type).
    \item The network graph is provided, which outlines the potential placement locations for splitters and the links (edges) connecting them.
    \item Each edge (fiber) has a cost per meter.
    \item Digging trenches has an associated cost.
    \item It is possible to lay multiple fibers in a single trench, termed as fiber duct sharing.
    \item Each splitter has an associated cost.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decision Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( y_{s} \) : Binary decision variable which is 1 if splitter \( s \) is selected and 0 otherwise.
    \item \( x_{e} \) : Binary decision variable which is 1 if edge \( e \) is selected and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objective}
Minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of selected splitters, the cost of laying fiber on selected edges, and the trenching cost.

Participants will be provided with a starting code (as shown above) which includes a JSON data structure containing the network graph.

\section{Evaluation}
Solutions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correctness: Does the solution respect all given constraints?
    \item Optimality: How close is the solution to the optimal cost?
    \item Computational Efficiency: How efficiently does the solution run?
\end{itemize}

\section{Submission Guidelines}
Participants are encouraged to use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) via Elytica to address the problem. However, if heuristics are employed, the implementation should be compilable on a Unix-based machine. For those using proprietary MIP solvers, a .lp file must be provided, which will be executed using HiGHS. All relevant code and results should be included in the submission.

\section{Datasets}
The intricacies of a JSON-formatted dataset are outlined in Listing \ref{lst:jsonstructure}. The dataset consists of two primary entities: \texttt{edges} and \texttt{nodes}.

Each \texttt{edge} represents a potential location for placing a fiber and is characterized by several attributes. The \texttt{weight} of an edge indicates its length. The unit cost of trenching is R150 per meter, while the cost of fiber is R50 per meter. This is used to calculate the total cost for each edge based on its length. Additionally, each edge has details about its starting point (\texttt{source}), endpoint (\texttt{target}), and a unique identifier (\texttt{id}).

The \texttt{nodes} encapsulate distinct network components with specified functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CO (Central Office) nodes are symbolized as squares, acting as the primary hubs for telecommunications.
    \item Triangles pinpoint potential locations for splitters which, when positioned, would be responsible for distributing optical signals.
    \item ONUs (Optical Network Units) are visualized as circles and act as service subscriber endpoints in the network.
    \item Intermediate nodes, which might serve as routing points or simple connection hubs, don't have a distinct type but remain essential for maintaining the network's connectivity.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:micronet} offers a visual representation of the \texttt{micronet.json} dataset, showcasing the interconnectedness of the nodes. The specific shape of each node allows for immediate identification of its role within the network, while the edges, underscore potential pathways for fiber and their corresponding lengths.
